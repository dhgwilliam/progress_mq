# = Class: progress
#
# This class sets up the MQ servers, MQ targets, and resources to watch for
# progression reporting of a puppet run. This class is set up to work either
# directly, or with Hiera.
#
# == Parameters:
#
# $servers:: This attribute is a hash of MQ server settings to which the
#            progress reporter may log. Each server hash is composed of the
#            following keys: $user, $host, $password, $port, $ssl and is used to
#            declare progress_server resources. May be declared in Hiera as
#            $progress_servers.
#
# $targets:: The target queues to which progress should be logged. May be a
#            string or an array. May be declared in Hiera as $progress_targets.
#
# $resources:: The resources of which to track the progress. May be a string or
#              an array.
#
# == Actions:
#   Configures the progress logging destination from the catalog in memory.
#
# == Requires:
#   - JSON ruby gem
#   - STOMP ruby gem
#
# == Sample Usage:
#   # If you have Hiera:
#   include progress
#
#   # Otherwise:
#   class { 'progress':
#     servers   => {
#       'example server' => {
#         host     => 'stomp.example.com',
#         user     => 'mq_user',
#         password => 'mq_user_password',
#       },
#     },
#     targets   => '/queue/progress',
#     resources => [
#       'package',
#       'service',
#     ],
#   }
#
